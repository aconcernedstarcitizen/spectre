# AUTOMATED SALE WAVE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# The app uses an automated multi-wave system:
# - Syncs time with reliable time servers for accuracy
# - Waits for each configured sale window
# - Polls for product page availability before each wave
# - Attempts checkout during each wave
# - Moves to next wave if checkout fails
# - Exits gracefully after successful purchase

# List of sale windows in UTC timezone
# REQUIRED: You must configure at least one sale window
# Format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" (24-hour format, UTC timezone)
#
# Standard CIG wave times (example for January 15, 2025):
# sale_windows:
#   - "2025-01-15 16:00"  # Wave 1: 4:00 PM UTC
#   - "2025-01-15 20:00"  # Wave 2: 8:00 PM UTC
#   - "2025-01-16 00:00"  # Wave 3: 12:00 AM UTC (next day)
#   - "2025-01-16 04:00"  # Wave 4: 4:00 AM UTC (next day)
